# **ADL4Reinterpretation**

This repository collects validated LHC analyses written in **ADL (Analysis Description Language)** and executed using the **CutLang runtime interpreter**.
The purpose of this project is to provide a reproducible set of analyses that can be directly used for **phenomenology studies** and **reinterpretation workflows**.

## **Repository structure**

The repository is organized into two branches:

- **The main branch** contains final ADL files and any necessary auxiliary materials such as ML models.
- **The validation branch** contains MC generation information and validation results, including cutflow comparisons, efficiency maps and comparisons, and limit comparisons for each analysis.
