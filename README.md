# Validation Branch

This branch contains all components required to validate the analyses provided in the `main` branch.
Each analysis has a dedicated validation workflow structured into two main directories:

---

## 1. MCGeneration/

This directory contains all files required to reproduce the Monte Carlo event generation chain:

- **SLHA files** – mass spectra and decay information for each signal model point
- **Process cards** – generator configurations defining the production processes
- **Delphes cards** – detector response settings consistent with the corresponding ATLAS/CMS analysis

These ingredients are used by **EM Creator** to generate simulated events.

---

## 2. ValidationResults/

This directory stores all outputs produced during the validation of each analysis:

- **Efficiency maps** – generated by CutLang, encapsulating acceptance × selection efficiency for each signal point and analysis region
- **Cutflow comparisons** – official ATLAS/CMS cutflow tables versus ADL/CutLang results
- **Limit comparison plots** – produced with **SModelS**, using EM Creator efficiency maps as input to compare predictions with the official simplified model limits

This structure provides full transparency and reproducibility for every validation step.

## Tools Used in the Validation

### EM Creator
EM Creator generates efficiency maps by combining Delphes-level simulated events with the ADL/CutLang analysis selections.
It automatically determines how many events satisfy the requirements of each signal region, providing a compact summary of detector acceptance and analysis efficiency.

### SModelS
SModelS consumes the efficiency maps produced by EM Creator and computes limit comparison plots.
Using official ATLAS/CMS simplified model results as reference, it evaluates the expected and observed exclusions and compares them to the predictions obtained from the validated analysis implementation.

Together, EM Creator and SModelS form a consistent and modular workflow for validating reinterpretation-ready analyses.
